Project: Browser History Manager
						
Objective:
						
To create a console-based application that simulates the history management functionality of a web browser using a doubly linked list. The program will allow users to visit new pages, go back to the previous page, move forward, and view the history.
						
Key Features:
						
1. Visit a New Page:
 - Simulate visiting a new web page, which adds the page to the history.
 - When a new page is visited, if there were any "forward" pages, they should be removed (similar to how real browsers work when you navigate after going back).
						
2. Go Back:
 - Move back to the previous page in the history.
 - Ensure that the user can’t go back if they’re at the first page in the history.
						
3. Go Forward:
 - Move forward to the next page in the history (if available).
 - Ensure that the user can’t go forward if they’re at the most recent page.
						
4. View History:
 - Display the complete browsing history from the first visited page to the current page.
 - Indicate the current page the user is on.
						
5. Clear History:
 - Clear all the history, starting fresh as if the browser was just opened.
